Deepfakes, particularly face swap techniques, have gained significant traction in recent 
years. However, existing models often suffer from limitations in accuracy, leading to 
inconsistencies and artifacts in the generated faces as well as the blurred output. Also, the 
existing related software programs are not widely available, are mostly paid and their
complexity is not user friendly. This thesis project tackles this challenge by proposing a novel 
web application for faceswap generation with improved enhanced output and a user-friendly 
experience.
Our project focuses on addressing the shortcomings of current faceswap models. With these 
models makes the generated blur, we particularly focus on the enhanced and accurate output 
while also having a user-friendly interface. We aim to develop a web application that 
leverages advancements in deep learning to achieve more realistic and seamless face 
swaps. The application will provide a user-friendly interface for uploading images and 
generating the desired faceswap results.
Face swap generation stands as a mesmerizing application of cutting-edge computer vision 
and deep learning techniques, offering the remarkable capability to seamlessly substitute one 
individual's face with another within images or videos. The intricate process relies heavily on 
sophisticated algorithms, with generative adversarial networks (GANs) emerging as a 
cornerstone technology. These networks comprise two primary components: a generator and 
a discriminator network. The generator's task is to produce synthetic faces, while the 
discriminator evaluates the authenticity of these generated faces compared to real faces 
sourced from a comprehensive dataset.
The inception of a face swap project typically begins with the meticulous collection of a 
diverse dataset, featuring the faces intended for swapping. This dataset acts as the bedrock 
for training the model and is subjected to meticulous preprocessing. This preprocessing 
phase ensures uniformity across various factors such as facial size, alignment, and color 
distribution, thus guaranteeing consistency and optimizing the quality of subsequent face 
swaps. Following dataset preparation, the model undergoes an extensive training regimen 
where the GAN learns the intricate nuances of facial characteristics, expressions, and 
variations present within the dataset. Through iterative training cycles, the model refines its 
understanding of facial features, gradually improving its ability to generate realistic synthetic 
faces.
Once adequately trained, the model is deployed to perform face swaps on images or videos. 
During this process, the model replaces the original faces with synthetic counterparts that 
seamlessly blend into the target context. To enhance the naturalness of the swapped faces, 
postprocessing techniques are often employed. These techniques may involve adjustments 
to lighting, color grading, and other visual elements to achieve a more cohesive and 
convincing result. Despite its widespread popularity for entertainment purposes, face swap 
technology is not without its ethical implications. The potential for misuse, particularly in the 
creation of deepfake content for nefarious purposes such as spreading misinformation or

perpetrating identity theft, underscores the importance of responsible development and 
usage of face swap applications. Robust ethical frameworks, coupled with stringent
regulatory measures, are essential to mitigate the risks associated with the proliferation of 
manipulated media and safeguard against potential harm to individuals and society at large.
In essence, while face swap technology continues to captivate audiences with its impressive 
capabilities, it is imperative to approach its development and deployment with a keen 
awareness of the ethical considerations at play. By prioritizing responsible innovation and 
ethical guidelines, the face swap generation community can contribute to fostering a safer 
and more trustworthy digital landscape for all users.
